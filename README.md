# Food Sharing

Food Sharing is a food sharing app. You have extra food that you like to share or trade with
the others. You make an account to the app and log in to share your food. You need to upload 
a beautiful image along with the other information namely: name of the food, expiration date 
of the food, sale value or sharing it for free, your choice. 

Do not waste food. What you waste coule be a meal for the others.

## Tech Stack
    1) Node.js
    2) Express.js
    3) React.js
    4) PostgreSQL

## I also used:
    * Session and passport for user authentication
    * Axios for making api calls
    * React Router
    * Cloudinary API to upload images
## Challenges
    * Making frontend talk to the backend
    * Routing 
    * Rendering different components when needed for the app to function smoothly.
    * Accesing form values and changing state accordingly
    * Managing state
    * My app.js file is insanly long. Wish I knew how to organize it properly.
    * Setting up authentication.
    * Building fullstack application.

## Wins     
    * It's my first fullstack application. So I will always remember it.
    * React is coming clear.
    * Making API calls from the frontend
    * App is responsive

## Post MVP:
    - Will add a search bar so people can search for food by names
    - Mock-up payment options
    - Add another API to dispatch emails upon making transactions to both parties (buyers, sellers).
